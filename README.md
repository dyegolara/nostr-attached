The main goal of this project is to have a completely Open-Source mobile client for the nostr-protocol.

I decided to use `react-native` because is the most widely known and approachable mobile development environment. Anyone that knows React, can build for React Native.

We are also using Expo as framework and their EAS, because we want to keep things simple and easy to deploy for fast iterationn on features and fixes.

This is a side project because I have a job but @jack, if you want to sponsor me to build this full-time, I'm open: @dyegolara on any platform.
